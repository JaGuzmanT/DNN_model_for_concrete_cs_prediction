# 🔥 DNN_model_for_concrete_cs_prediction 🔥

This repository contains a deep neural network model that is capable to predcit accurately the concrete compressive strength using destructive and non-destructive tests. The model was trained using the following main features. 👨🏻‍💻

Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), Electrical resistivity (Er), Resonance frequency (FR), Tensile strength (Ts), and Compressive strength (CS). 👨🏻‍💻
