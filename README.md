# 🔥 DNN_model_for_concrete_cs_prediction 🔥

<p align="center"> This repository contains a deep neural network model that is capable of predicting accurately the concrete compressive strength using destructive and non-destructive tests as features or regressors. The model was trained using the following main features. 👨🏻‍💻

Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), Electrical resistivity (Er), Resonance frequency (FR), Tensile strength (Ts), and Compressive strength (CS). 👨🏻‍💻 </p>

## Description of the repository

<p align="justify"> The repository contains two folders. The first one contains all the preprocessing steps and their respective codes, the images generated by the descriptive and inferential statistics. The second one contains the following files.
A Jupyter notebook called "2. DNN model.ipynb", stores all the necessary code for using the deep neural network as a new model.
Two files with .npz extension are related to training and testing data in Tensorflow format.
The file named "final_model.h5" is the final model that contains the weights obtained from the training process of the deep neural network.
Also, two image files represent the architecture of the model and the obtained results from the training process. </p>

Approach: Supervised machine learning problems and regression problems.
